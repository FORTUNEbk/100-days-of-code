# Day 1
This code is a basic example of a Java program, demonstrating the fundamental structure of a Java class and the use of the System.out.println method to print text to the console. This type of program is commonly used as an introductory example for learning Java programming, often referred to as the "Hello World" program.
# Day 2
Within the main method, three variables are declared and initialized with specific values: an integer num set to 21, a double num2 set to 30.0, and a string text set to "Hello". The program then uses the System.out.println method to print these values to the console, each preceded by a descriptive label. Specifically, it prints "Integer: 21" for the integer, "Double: 30.0" for the double, and "String: Hello" for the string. This code demonstrates basic variable declaration, initialization, and output in Java, illustrating how different data types can be used and displayed in a straightforward manner.
# Day 3
It creates an instance of the Scanner class to read input from the standard input stream (typically the keyboard).
It prompts the user to input a string, reads the input using scanner.nextLine(), and stores it in the variable text.
It prompts the user to input an integer, reads the input as a string, converts it to an integer using Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine()), and stores it in the variable number.
It prompts the user to input a double, reads the input as a string, converts it to a double using Double.valueOf(scanner.nextLine()), and stores it in the variable decimal.
It prompts the user to input a boolean, reads the input as a string, converts it to a boolean using Boolean.valueOf(scanner.nextLine()), and stores it in the variable value.
It then prints each of the captured inputs back to the console with descriptive messages.
Finally, it closes the Scanner object to release the associated resources.
