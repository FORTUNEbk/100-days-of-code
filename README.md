# Day 1
The program outputs the string "Hello world"
# Day 2
The progran initializes an integer, double and String. It then gives values to the initialized variables and print them the out.
# Day 3
It creates an instance of the Scanner class to read input from the standard input stream (typically the keyboard).
It prompts the user to input a string, reads the input using scanner.nextLine(), and stores it in the variable text.
It prompts the user to input an integer, reads the input as a string, converts it to an integer using Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine()), and stores it in the variable number.
It prompts the user to input a double, reads the input as a string, converts it to a double using Double.valueOf(scanner.nextLine()), and stores it in the variable decimal.
It prompts the user to input a boolean, reads the input as a string, converts it to a boolean using Boolean.valueOf(scanner.nextLine()), and stores it in the variable value.
It then prints each of the captured inputs back to the console with descriptive messages.
Finally, it closes the Scanner object to release the associated resources.
